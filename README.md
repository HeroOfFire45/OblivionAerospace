# Oblivion Aerospace

A small parts package of heat shields for Kerbal Space Program and the fabulous Deadly Reentry Continued mod created by NathanKell (who is awesome) based on the works by ialdabaoth and r4m0n.

* Currently featuring the *Conical Heat Shield* inspired by the sphere-cone heat shield on the Mars Science Laboratory.
  * Comes in three sizes: 1.25m, 2.5m, and 3.75m.
  * Works great with Ferram Aerospace Research by ferram4 in that sphere-cone shaped heat shields offer greater control (by lift) over blunt ones.

Thanks to...
* ialdabaoth and r4m0n, for creating the excellent Deadly Reentry mod, and to NathanKell for extending upon and maintaining it. Heat shields would be boring without it!
* ferram4, for creating Ferram Aerospace Research, which really makes the KSP experience for me!
* Squad, for making such a great game!
