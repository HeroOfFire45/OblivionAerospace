ShieldsPack
===========

A small parts package of heat shields for Kerbal Space Program and the fabulous Deadly Reentry Continued mod created by NathanKell based on the works by ialdabaoth (who is awesome) and r4m0n.

* Currently only featuring the *Conical Heat Shield* inspired by the sphere-cone heat shield on the Mars Science Laboratory.
  * It comes in three variants and sizes: 1.25m, 2.5m, and 3.75m.
  * It works great with Ferram Aerospace Research by ferram4 in that sphere-cone shaped heat shields offer greater control (by lift) over blunt ones.

Licence is GNU GPL v3 (see `LICENCE` for details).

# Installation

Install by merging the `GameData` folder in the zip with the `GameData` folder in your KSP install.

* Deadly Reentry Continued is recommended, but not required for this mod to work.

# Changelog

* **v0.1.0** Initial work-in-progress pre-release.
